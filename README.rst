================
visaplan.kitchen
================

This package tackles "soup", i.e. trees which are created by the well-known
beautifulsoup4 package from parsed HTML or XML sources.
It might be possible to accomplish the same by using lxml directly,
but it might have been more difficult, and thus it is left to another
product.

Features
--------

- ``spoons`` module, for tackling "soup", e.g.

  - ``has_any_class`` (a filter function to check for one of the given classes)

- ``forks`` module
  (named mainly for historical reasons; for poking around in the soup), e.g.
  ``extract_linktext``, ``convert_dimension_styles``

- ``ids`` module, for creation of new ids for HTML elements

  - ``id_factory``::

    new_id = id_factory(...)
    id = new_id(prefix)


Examples
--------

This add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:

- https://www.unitracc.de

Documentation
-------------

For now, the functions are documented by doctests.


Installation
------------

Install visaplan.kitchen by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        visaplan.kitchen


and then running ``bin/buildout``
